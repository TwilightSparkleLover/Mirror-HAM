          define what to divide the shift layer values with before displaying.

.	Fix direction of [Shift]-[Up] & [Shift]-[Down] in tUME.INI.
.	Fix [Shift]-[Up] & [Shift]-[Down] to move by two tiles in tUME.INI.

tUME v00.2624, 02/21/94 *******************************************************

.	Add ability shift (offset) a layer:

          You may shift an unlocked layer by one or more tiles. By default,
          tUME sets up these key definitions:

          KEY             ACTION
          ---             ------
          [Shift]-[Up]    shift layer "north" one tile
          [Shift]-[Down]  shift layer "south" one tile

          A shifted layer will be marked by an "*" between the total number
          of layers and the current layer on the status bar. To unshift an
          unlocked layer, press lower-case [z]. To unshift all unlocked
          layers in the current room, press [Shift]-[Z].

          You may change how many tiles a layer is shifted for each key
          press by modifying the [Shift Layer Events] in the tUME.INI file.

          The layer shift information is not saved.

.	Add ability to display on the status bar how far a layer has
	been shifted. The "coordinates" change to angle brackets when
	displaying the layer shift amounts.

          By default this event is attached to [F4].

.	Add support for pixel-level tile select:

          Tile selection is now made on a pixel level. Any tiles pixel
          that is touched by the selection rectangle will be included
          in the tile-brush. This allows for more flexibility in selecting
          isometric tiles.

.	Add support for isometric tiles:

          tUME now supports isometric tiles. When you load the tileset,
          set the tileset user type to 13 (Isometric Tiles), the tile width
          to 32, and the tile height to 16. The isometric tiles should be
          drawn as a 32x16 pixel diamond shape tile. Isometric tiles are
          pasted into an 8x8 pixel tile grid, with the additional restriction
          that they are pasted into an isometric grid.

tUME v00.2623, 02/04/94 *******************************************************

.	Add allowing [Shift] key to highlight letters in dialog boxes.

.	Change palette download address for SNASM & PsyQ SNES & Genesis:

	New SNES palette address: $000202, length $100.
	New Genesis palette address: $FFFF80, length $80.

	In addition, a word which contains the palette size is downloaded
	each time the palette is downloaded. You may examine this word
	to determine when a new palette has arrived (if you set it to 0
	after you have processed the new palette):

	For SNES, the value 256 is stored at address $000200.
	For Genesis, the value 128 is stored at address $FFFF7E.

.	Fix deleting highlighted letters in file requester deleting too much.

	and HSVSPREAD (broken in v00.2600).

tUME v00.2600, 08/04/93 *******************************************************

.	Add ability to insert a layer:

          Inserting a Layer

          To insert a layer at the current floor layer of the current
          room, choose Layer|Insert. The previous floor layer and all
          layers above the floor get pushed up.

          This function is assigned to the event "InsertLayer".

.	Add ability to save a layer:

          Saving a Layer

          To save a layer from the current room, move the floor to the
          layer to be saved and choose Layer|Save...

          This function is assigned to the event "SaveLayer".

.	Add ability to load a layer:

          Loading a Layer

          To load a saved layer and insert it as the current floor layer
          of the current room, choose Layer|Load... The previous floor
          layers and all layers above the floor get pushed up.

          This function is assigned to the event "LoadLayer".

.	Add ability to append a layer:

          Appending a Layer

          To load a saved layer and append it as the topmost layer of the
          current room, choose Layer|Append...

          This function is assigned to the event "AppendLayer".

.	Add ability to export the screen as an IFF picture:

          You can export the current screen as an IFF picture by choosing
          View|Export Screen...

          This function is assigned to the event "ExportScreen".

.	Add ability to export current room as an IFF picture:

          To export the current room as an IFF picture choose
          Room|Export.... The following settings affect how the exported
          image will appear:

          * the layers currently visible (choose Layer|Invisible to change);
          * the current View|Zoom and View|Guide settings;
          * the current View|EditOnlyFloor, View|Spaced Toggle, and
            View|EditColorsOnly settings;
          * the current View|Disable|Priority, View|Disable|Flip, and
            View|Disable|Colorsets settings; and
          * the current View|Background Color setting.

          To export the floor layer in a form that can re-imported back
          into tUME, use the following settings:

          * disable Layer|Invisible (make the current floor visible);
          * disable View|Zoom (display tiles at actual size) and disable
            View|Guide (don't show guides);
          * enable View|EditOnlyFloor (show only one layer) and disable

            View|Disable|Colorsets (don't show colorsets);
          * set the Background Color to the same color as the transparent
            color.

          This function is assigned to the event "ExportRoom".

.	Add ability to export current brush as an IFF picture:

          You can export the current brush as an IFF picture by choosing
          Brush|Export... Note that the zoom and tile-spacing setting of
          the current room affects the exported image.

          This function is assigned to the event "ExportBrush".

.	Add ability to highlight tiles in source rooms:

          Highlight Tile in Source Room

          Sometimes, when you have many source tiles, it becomes difficult
          to see where a particular tile is defined. Use Highlight Tile to
          locate the tile within the source room where the tile is defined.

          To highlight a tile in a source room, first select a tile-brush
          that includes the tile you wish to highlight in the upper left
          corner. Choose Tiles|Highlight Tile (or press [Alt]-h), and tUME
          will change the view to show the source room and the highlighted
          tile.

          If there are more tiles in the tile-brush then subsequent presses
          of [Alt]-h will cycle through the tiles in the tile-brush from
          left to right, top to bottom, floor layer to ceiling (wrapping at
          end).

          This function is assigned to the event "HighlightTile" ('<Alt-H>').

.	Add ability to smart flip to tileset for current layer:

          Smart Flip makes the appropriate source tiles for the current
          edit room floor layer visible when you press [Spacebar] in an
          edit room pane. Choosing View|Toggle Smart Flip enables this
          feature and redefines the behavior of View|Flip Panes, [Spacebar]
          and j.

          If you have more than one source room whose tiles can appear in
          the same layer, Smart Flip will show the source room that you
          most recently selected a tile-brush from.

          The tileset chosen for a given layer are specified through the
          tileset user types and are defined in the tUME.INI file; see the
          Redefining Layer Types section of the tUME Configuration Guide.

          Redefining Layer Types

          Layer Types are currently only used by the Smart Flip feature.
          Layer Types define which tileset user types are associated with
          each layer. Thus, when you press [Spacebar] while Smart Flip is
          enabled, tUME will find the last source room with the same
          tileset user type for the floor layer.

          In the tUME.INI file, there is a section called [Type Groups]
          with three lines in it:

               TileType=MCKids 2 Tileset Types
               RoomTypes=MCKids 2 Room Types
               LayerTypes=MCKids 2 Layer Types

          Only LayerTypes are described here. The string following the
          LayerType= defines the name of the section to look in for the
          of layer types. You may have several layer type lists in the
          tUME.INI file, and select one just by changing the label
          following the TileType=. In tUME.INI, there is a section called
          [MCKids 2 Layer Types] that looks like this:

               [MCKids 2 Layer Types]
               Layer 1=0,4,5,6,7,8
               Layer 2=1
               Layer 3=2
               Layer 4=3
               Layer 5=0,4,5,6,7,8
               Layer 6=1
               Layer 7=2
               Layer 4=3

          This section lists all the layers that are defined. The text to
          the left of the '=' is the layer number being defined. The comma-
          separated list following the '=' lists all tileset user types
          that may be pasted into the layer on the left.

          Thus when Smart Flip is enabled, and the floor is layer 2 of an
          edit room, pressing [Spacebar] will display the source room that
          contains the most recently selected tiles of user type 1 (defined
          as Contour Tiles in the next section). Or if the floor is layer 1
          of an edit room, will display the most recently selected tiles in
          a source room containing tiles of user type 0, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8.

          This function is enabled with the event "ToggleSmartFlip".

.	Add ability to display tile usage counts:

          Chhoosing Tiles|Show Tile Usage will cause a grid of tile usage
          numbers to appear over every floor tile in the room. The number
          shows how many times the tile in the floor layer is used.

          The numbers have different meanings, depending on whether the
          room is an edit or a source room. In an edit room, the tile usage
          number indicates how many times the floor tile appears in the
          current edit room only. In a source room, the number indicates
          how many times the floor tile appears in all edit rooms.

          If the tile usage count is too large to be displayed in the
          current tile, +'s will displayed instead of the tile usage count.
          In this case, zoom in to make each tile larger and to show more
          of the tile usage count.

          You can limit the largest tile usage count displayed by choosing
          Tiles|Set Usage Limit...

.	Add ability to set largest tile usage count to display:

          Choosing Tiles|Set Usage Limit... will bring up a dialog box that
          will allow you to set the largest tile usage count that will be
          displayed. Enter a new maximum tile usage count, press [Enter],
          and tUME will display all tile usage counts that are less than or
          equal to your limit value.

          E.g., you want to see tiles that are "infrequently used". You
          have arbitrarily decided that a tile is infrequently used if it
          appears five times or less. Choose Tiles|Set Usage Limit...,
          enter 5, and press [Enter]. tUME will now display tile usage
          numbers only for the tiles that are used five times or less.

.	Add ability to save and load palettes:

          When the palette requester is active the menus change to allow
          you to save and load palettes.

          Colors|Load...

          Choose this option to load a palette stored in an IFF file into
          the currently active palette. This function is enabled with the
          event "LoadPalette". You may not attach a key to this event.
          This event only works when the palette requester is active.

          Colors|Save...

          Choose this option to save the currently active palette to an IFF
          file. This function is enabled with the event "SavePalette".
          You may not attach a key to this event. This event only works
          when the palette requester is active.

.	Add ability to save and load a palette range:

          When the palette requester is active the menus change to allow
          you to save and load palette ranges.

          Range|Load...

          Choose this option to load a saved color cycling range stored in
          an IFF file into the currently selected palette range. This
          function is enabled with the event "LoadPaletteRange". You may
          not attach a key to this event. This event only works when the
          palette requester is active.

          After selecting the file to load, a dialog will be presented,
          requesting you to specify the first color to copy. This defaults
          to the first color of the first color cycle range in the palette.
          Press [Enter] to accept this default value, or enter a new first
          paletter number. The number of colors loaded will be the number
          of colors selected in the palette.

          Range|Save...

          Choose this option to save the currently selected palette range
          to an IFF file as a color cycling range. This function is enabled
          with the event "SavePaletteRange". You may not attach a key to
          this event. This event only works when the palette requester
          is active.

          The first color and number of colors saved in the color cycle
          range is based on the currently selected palette range.

.	Add keys for INSERT, DELETE, COPY, BLEND, SWAP in palette requester.

.	Add ability to specify a initial map filename on the command line.

.	Change menu so they are easier to navigate via a keyboard.

tUME v00.2521, 05/13/93 *******************************************************

.	Add configurable tile flag matching when counting brushes & searching:

          Configuring Search and Replace

          As supplied, when tUME is counting brushes, searching, or
          replacing, it tries to match tiles exactly; i.e., it searches for
          tiles with the same flipping, same priority, and same colorset.
          The FlagBits= line in the group [Search Options] defines which
          tile flag bits to match. Thus if the tile flag bit 4 is the
          priority bit, then the following lines will ignore tile
          priorities when searching:

                    [Search Options]
                    FlagBits=111x1111

.	Fix [MCKids 2 Tileset Types] section in tUME.INI so that contour,
	special & object defaults to no flip and no priority.

tUME v00.2519, 04/29/93 *******************************************************

.	Add ability to specify search directories for tilesets:

          Configuring Tileset Search Path

          By default, tUME loads tilesets using the directory and filename
          specified in the tUME map file. This can be a problem if you move
          tilesets to another sub-directory (perhaps on a different
          machine). To adress this problem, tUME will use the following
          search strategy in loading tilesets:

          1. [DEFAULT]        Load tileset using the directory saved in the
                              tUME map file. If not found, then
          2. [USER-SPECIFIED] Search sub-directories specified by user, if
                              any. If not found, then
          3. [tUME.INI]       Search sub-directories specified by
                              SearchDir's, if any. If not found, then
          4. [tUME.INI]       Search current sub-directory, if
                              SearchCurrentDir=1. If not found, then
          5. [ASK USER]       Can't load 'tileset'! Would you like to try a
                              different file?

          Option 2 sub-directories are added by the user when they click
          Yes in response to the question "Try to load other 'problem'
          tilesets from here?"

          Option 3 is useful when you copy maps from another machine and
          you want to place all tilesets in a separate sub-directory from
          the tUME map. E.g., if you want tUME to search the sub-directory
          Z:\PROJECT\ART for tileset files, add the following lines to the
          tUME.INI file:

               [Load Options]
               SearchDir=Z:\PROJECT\ART

          If you want to search the sub-directory C:\GOOD\ART as well,
          simply add another line:

               SearchDir=C:\GOOD\ART

          Option 4 is useful when you copy maps from another machine and
          you want to place the tUME map and its tileset files in the same
          sub-directory. To enable this option, add the following lines to
          the tUME.INI file:

               [Load Options]
               SearchCurrentDir=1

          Option 5 is useful if you want to rename a tileset. Change the
          tileset name before you start tUME. When tUME tries to load the
          renamed tileset, it won't find it, and then it will give you a
          chance to specify the new filename.

.	Fix file requesters to show network drives again (broke 00.2506).

          Configuring the File Requester

          You may configure the file requester to either display the
          directories and files alphabetically intermixed or display all
          the directories first, then all the files.

          To configure the file requester to list all the directories
          first, then all the files, set DirsAtTop= in the [File Requester]
          section of the tUME.INI file to 1; to configure the file
          requester to list the directories and files intermixed
          alphabetically, set DirsAtTop= in the [File Requester] section of
          the tUME.INI file to 0:

               [File Requester]
               DirsAtTop=0

          Note that if you set DirsAtTop=0, the [Files] and [Dirs] buttons
          do not appear in the file requester.

.	Brushes shown with no transp if EditOnlyFloor.

.	Fix downloaded colorset wrong if priority set.

tUME v00.2502, 01/27/93 *******************************************************

.	Add ability to not display priority, flipping & colorsets:

          Displaying Priorities

          By default, tUME shows the tile priority settings. You may
          disable the display of priorities by choosing
          View|Disable|Priority, and re-enable display of priorities by
          choosing the same option again.

          Displaying Flip

          By default, tUME shows flipped tiles as they have been set. You
          may disable the display of tile flipping by choosing
          View|Disable|Flip, and re-enable display of flipped tiles by
          choosing the same option again.

          Displaying Colorsets

          By default, tUME shows tile in the colorsets as they have been
          set. You may disable the display of tile colorsets by choosing
          View|Disable|Colorsets, and re-enable display of tile colorsets
          by choosing the same option again.

.	Add ability to reset priority with the right mouse button:

          Colorsets

          ...

          To use the default 8 colorsets you need to draw your tiles in a
          particular way. Each tile needs to use one set of 16 colors in
          DPaint. Either the first set of 16 colors (0 - 15) or the second
          set of 16 colors (16 - 31) or the third set of 16 colors (32 -
          47) and on to the eighth set of 16 colors (112 - 128).

          When you make your rooms in tUME using these tiles they will be
          drawn in the color you used in DPaint. If you want to change them
          to one of the other colorsets, first pick up a tile-brush, then
          press 1, 2, 3 through 8 on the numeric keypad to choose colorsets
          1 thru 8 (or 0 thru 7 for you programmer types). The word 'COLOR'
          will appear attached to the cursor, and now when you stamp a
          brush with the left mouse button, instead of actually placing
          tiles in your room, you will be changing the colorsets of
          ("coloring") the tiles you stamp over. To change the tiles back
          to their original colors, stamp with the right mouse button.

          Press . (period) on the keypad to exit the colorset coloring mode
          and return to the regular tUME drawing mode (where you place
          tiles instead of just changing their colors).

          Priorities

          Priorities are something that is really only used on the
          SNES/GENESIS systems, though you may find other uses for it. On
          those systems individual tiles may be marked as having a higher
          priority so that the system's sprites will appear to go behind
          those tiles. Editing or setting the priorities of tiles works
          exactly like the colorsets.

          Grab a tile-brush and then press + on the numeric keypad. The
          word 'COLOR' will appear attached to the cursor, and now when you

          stamp with the left mouse button, you will set the priority bit
          of all the tiles you stamp on to 1. If you stamp with the right
          mouse button, you will reset the priority bit of the tiles you
          stamp on back to 0.

          Tiles that have there priority set to 1 will be draw in colors
          128 through 255. For example if your tile uses colors 16..31 and
          you set its priority to 1 then it will now be drawn in colors
          144..159 (16+128..31+128). It is up to you to set these colors to
          something you will recognize. You may want to set them to that
          same colors as the originals except with a lighter or darker
          shade, or you may want to set them all to shades of red or shades
          of grey. Choose anything that will make it clear which tiles have
          their priority set to 1.

          Press . (period) on the keypad to exit priority setting mode and
          return to the regular tUME drawing mode (where you place tiles
          instead of just changing their priorities).

.	Add msg "Search Buffer defined." when user presses Ctrl-S.
.	Add ability to press ESC to escape from Replacing ALL.
.	Add ESC to leave Replace dialog, Enter to replace one.

.	Make zoom in/out start from 1:1 (vs. previous) if zoom off.

tUME v00.2501, 01/22/93 *******************************************************

.	Always show flipped tiles, even if tileset is unflipped.
.	Make brush pick-up unflipped brush if tileset is unflipped.

tUME v00.2500, 01/20/93 *******************************************************

.	Add ability to display rooms using edit palettes only:

          Tileset Display Colors

          A tileset is normally displayed using the palette found in its
          DPaint picture. However, there is an option to display the source
          tiles using the current edit room's palette. Choose
          View|EditColorsOnly or press [Alt]-E, and the source room will be
          displayed using the last edit room's palette. This feature is
          useful when you have a tileset that is designed to use different
          palettes to change its appearance.

          E.g., lets say you have a marble tileset that's designed to
          appear as green marble in the OFFICE edit room, and as grey
          marble in the HALL edit room. Switch to the OFFICE edit room, and
          choose View|EditColorsOnly. Now when you switch to the marble
          tileset, the tiles will appear green. Switch to the HALL edit
          room, and then when you switch to the marble tileset, the tiles
          will appear grey. Choose View|EditColorsOnly again, and the
          marble tileset will be displayed using its DPaint palette.

          Note that if you select this option while in a source room, it
          will not take effect until you switch to an edit room.

.	Add ability to search, search and replace:

          Search and Replace

          tUME allows you search for a particular tile-brush, and to
          replace what you've found with another tile-brush.

          The Search Buffer

          tUME will search for whatever is in the Search Buffer. You place
          a tile-brush in the Search Buffer by pressing [Ctrl]-S. Pressing
          s will search across, then down, starting at the current pointer
          location, for the next occurrence of the Search Buffer.

          Searching

          To find a particular group of tiles, follow these steps:

          1. Select the tiles to search for: press v or b, then select the
          tiles you want to search for.

          2. Place the tiles to search for in the Search Buffer by pressing
          [Ctrl]-S or choosing Brush|Search|Set Buffer.

          3. Switch to the room you wish to search, then position the
          pointer to where you want to start searching from. Note that if
          you position the pointer directly over a match, search will find
          the next match.

          4. Press s or choose Brush|Search|Search to find the first match.
          tUME will search across, then down starting from the current
          pointer location. The room will be re-positioned, and the pointer
          will be placed over the match, which will be surrounded by an
          outline.

          5. Press s again to find the next match. Once a match has been
          found, subsequent searches will continue from the previous match
          (the search outline).

          When searching, tUME matches tiles starting from the current
          floor and up. Invisible layers match everything. E.g., you place
          a three layer brush in the Search Buffer. In the edit room, you
          place the floor on the first layer, and you make the second layer
          invisible. tUME will match the first layer of the Search Buffer
          with the first layer of the edit room, and the third layer of the
          Search Buffer with the third layer of the edit room. Since the
          second layer of the edit room is invisible, it matches
          everything, and is not compared against the second layer of the
          Search Buffer.

          Note: you may wish to press [Ctrl]-[Home] between steps 3 and 4
          to move to the start of the room.

          Note: when you place a tile brush into the Search Buffer, the
          previous match (search outline) is removed.

          Searching and Replacing

          To find a particular group of tiles, and replace the tiles with
          another group of tiles, follow these steps:

          1. Select the tiles to search for: press v or b, then select the
          tiles you want to search for.

          2. Place the tiles to search for in the Search Buffer by pressing
          [Ctrl]-S or choosing Brush|Search|Set Buffer.

          3. Select the tiles to replace with: press v or b, then select
          the tiles you want to replace with.

          4. Switch to the room you wish to search and replace, then
          position the pointer to where you want to start searching and
          replacing from. Note that if you position the pointer directly
          over a match, the replacing will start from the next match.

          5. Press r or choose Brush|Search|Replace to find the first
          match. tUME will search across, then down starting from the
          current pointer location. The room will be re-positioned, and the
          pointer will be placed over the match, which will be surrounded
          by an outline.

          6. tUME will bring up a dialog box that asks you, "Replace
          tiles?", with four options: Yes, No, All, and Exit.

               A. Selecting Yes or pressing [Enter] will replace the
               matching tiles with the tiles in the tile-brush, and tUME
               will find the next matching tiles, and bring up the "Replace
               tiles?" dialog box again.

               B. Selecting No will skip replacing this match, and tUME
               will find the next matching tiles, and bring up the "Replace
               tiles?" dialog box again.

               C. Selecting All will cause tUME to find each and every
               matching group of tiles in the current room, and replace
               each and every one with the current tile-brush. Pressing
               [Spacebar] will interrupt this function.

               D. Selecting Exit or pressing [Esc] will stop the replace
               function.

               Notes about Search and Replace

          You may undo the last search and replace operation by pressing u.

          Invisible layers match everything; they are not searched.

          tUME only replaces tiles in unlocked layers. Search and replace
          uses the current brush paste mode setting (either paint mode or
          replace mode) when replacing tiles.
